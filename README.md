Colorblox Basic, Open-Source version.

This app made for Roblox cheating. It uses Mouse Event (Win32API) for simulate mouse movements. This method detected by most anti-cheats such as Vanguard or Easy-AntiCheat. But for Roblox, it works well and it's completely undetected.
The app does not write or read memory so in-built anti-cheats such as Rolve Anti-Cheat (Arsenal) can't detect it.

How to Use Tutorial:
1- Go to "python.org" and download "Python 3.12.0"
2- Run installer and select "Add python.exe to PATH" then install Python.
3- When installation is complete, run "requirements.bat" and wait until cmd closes (If you want, you can check .bat file's inside too).
4- Run main.py directy or using cmd. (for cmd, there is code --> "python main.py")
5- Find the color from game and go to any color picker website and find color's RGB format (e.g. 255, 0, 0)
6- Set your color using palette and have fun!

Note: If you can't see FoV, make sure the aim assist is enabled and active it using our keybind (it is "Shift" as default).

Colorblox is completely open-source. If you are concerned, you can examine the codes. No data is received or sent anywhere else in the app. You can also verify from the code that this is not the case.
